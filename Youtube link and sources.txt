I apologize for the shortcomings of the project.
I learned a lot throughout this project, and that makes me happy. The lessons from this project are immense, so even though I couldn’t fully complete the assignment, it has been a significant achievement for me.

Im not sure why the AABB collisions are not successful; I can’t locate what I’m missing. I might have defined the object's dimensions incorrectly. My coding skills may not be sufficient yet.
I want to continuously improve this project, and I believe that one day I’ll figure it out.
Thank you!
